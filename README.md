This is a library of signatures developed in the exercises for the
PETS lecture in winter semester 16/17.

## Directories
- `libsig` contains the sourcecode, as well as doctests
- `test` contains more extensive tests, if that is necessary for your signature scheme
- `doc` contains the sphinx-documentation
