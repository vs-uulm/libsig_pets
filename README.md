This is a library of signatures developed in the exercises for the
PETS lecture in winter semester 16/17 at the [Institute of Distributed
Systems](https://www.uni-ulm.de/en/in/vs/) at Ulm University.

WARNING: These schemes are not tested for their security and their
implementation may be insecure. If you are programming something where
security is important do not use them. The implemented schemes are
rather a proof of concept.

## Directories
- `libsig` contains the sourcecode, as well as doctests
- `test` contains more extensive tests, if that is necessary for your signature scheme
- `doc` contains the sphinx-documentation
